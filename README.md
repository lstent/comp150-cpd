# Semester 1

## Summary of experience
My career goal is to become a programmer in a AAA studio. To reach this goal I need to improve on independent study, presentations, understanding and remembering code, time management, spelling and punctuation. I hope to improve these abilities by the end of the spring term in April, and by the end of the year, I plan to be fully competent in these skills. These goals are important to my future career by increasing my ability to communicate with co-workers, any problems that arise. It will also improve the quality of my coding, and problem solving, which is a crucial part of becoming a good programmer that a AAA studio would want to hire.

## Week 1
LEGO robot Olympics, we built and programmed simple tasks with LEGO robots, then programmed them to complete challenges in the second week. My group won because we practised each task repeatedly, the only task we didn’t repeat we failed; this taught me the importance of testing.

## Week 2
Game concepts design, we worked on producing a board game for a certain demographic then pitch our design to the rest of the class, our first attempt was very confusing as everyone’s ideas didn’t match, I also learnt the importance of playing your prototype to find and repair problems before pitching.

## Week 3
Agile game development, I was absent for the morning practical lesson, and learnt about Agile in the afternoon lecture.

## Week 4
Game version control, using TortoiseGit, in groups we had to create the PONG game by transferring Pycharm files between computers, I didn’t transfer any files so therefore didn’t learn how to use TortoiseGit, and barely new any coding to help build PONG. I have slowly learnt how to use TortoiseGit through my 120 tinkering graphics project.

## Week 5
Presenting to game Designers, I spent ages making sprites and nice text boxes to present my game, then on the day I couldn’t show anyone my handout and I forgot all my information, I learnt that I get very nervous during presentations and need more practise.

## Week 6
Learnt how to use LaTex to write scholarly papers, which I found very difficult to understand, I will practise this in my own time and watch a tutorial to help.

## Week 7
Finally chose my Agile question and presented it to an Agile professional, presenting was a tiny bit better than last time, but still needs practise.

## Week 8
Was absent for Monday and Tuesday from flu, Wednesday tinkering audio didn't understand any of the lectures and couldn't do the workshop, went over it with Michael understood it a bit better and realised I need to go over my maths again.

## Week 9
Finally made a start on collision for Slime Evo realised I have no idea what a class is and how to make one to track the sprites movement, Tinkering audio 2 couldn't follow any of the lectures must ask one of my tutors to explain it all to me again.

## Week 10
Agile peer review peer review, I found the main criticisms from my peers were spelling and punctuation, with help from my dyslexic tutor I am slowly improving.

## Week 11
Tinkering audio peer review, because of my previous deadlines, I had committed nothing to Github and completed no work towards this assignment, this shows I need to improve my time management in the future.

## Week 12
The desktop game hand in, collision was still acting the way it shouldn't, I should have managed my time better and asked my tutors to look over my code by making a pull request on Github, which I will be taking advantage of next semester.

# Semester 2

## Week 1
Introduction to visual studio c++ and Unreal blueprints, which I found especially difficult switching from python to unreal but watching pluralsight turorials should help me understand and get me used to these programs. First real PO meeting I need to start going to stand up meetings

## Week 2
Learning c++ standards and using blueprints to contribute to the group game, also creating a collectable blueprint in comp140, is increasing my knowledge quickly, and I am beginning to understand. Getting Eds worksheets done, proof of good time management?

## Week 3
Wasn't in all week due to flu, but working on NPC roam and chase for group game.

## Week 4
Learnt about game engines and architecture which can help me with my software engineering essay, reading furthur material will help my understanding of the subject. Finnished roam and chase, started my Arduino coding for my controller but I don't really understand it, I will watch online tutorials and practice with it.

## Week 5
Forgot about CPD, had to quickly go through all the previous weeks and remember what happened. For the group game I programmed the player to make noise, volume depending on movement speed and AI can hear which means the player can no longer hide behind AIs back, stared learning aout servers in comp 160, which I studied in CHE but can't remember anything, I will look through my old internet and server books to refresh my knowledge.

## Week 6
Made a take damage on collide for player health in the group game, which requires some bug fixing but concentrating mainly on the game for comp140 which is almost finnished ready for the viva next week, its starting to look like I'm definatly improving on timekeeping for assignments. Went into every stand up meeting but everyone was arriving late or the stand up wouldnt happen at all, seems like a waste of my time

## Week 7
Fixed player health from taking random damage and slowly drains on continued collsion, viva went well I think had difficulty explaining myself at times, stopped going to stand up meeting so I could start the comp160 software engineering essay.

## Week 8
Had flue so wasn't in all week, finnished off comp140 game for hand in on the 20th, worked on software engineering essay and created respawn player, making sure all widgets respawn aswell for the group game.

## Week 9
Finished Ed's worksheets assignment, started creating a phone usage bar for the group game, while doing the software engineering essay also doing the CPD assignment and research essay, everything really starting to pile on top of one another.

## Week 10
